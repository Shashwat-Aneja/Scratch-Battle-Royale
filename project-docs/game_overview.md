# Game Overview — Scratch Battle Royale

This document describes the full game design of the Scratch Battle Royale project.  
The project was originally created in Scratch and is now documented as a game logic and design archive.

The game features:
- Player movement and shooting  
- Enemy bots that follow the player  
- A shrinking safe zone  
- Health and damage system  
- Win/lose conditions  

Scratch was used to implement the mechanics through event-driven programming and sprite cloning.
