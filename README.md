# Scratch Battle Royale (Documentation-Only Version)

This repository documents the full game logic, design, and systems behind my Scratch-based Battle Royale game.  
The original `.sb3` file is not available, so this repository serves as a clean, professionally structured technical documentation archive.

## 🎮 Project Summary

This Battle Royale game was originally created using Scratch's block programming. It includes:

- Player movement and collision
- Shooting mechanics using clones
- Enemy AI that tracks and follows the player
- Health system for player and enemies
- Shrinking safe zone that forces movement
- Win/lose conditions based on survival

Even without the `.sb3` file, this repository provides a full breakdown of the internal architecture and logic.
